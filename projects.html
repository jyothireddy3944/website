  <h2>Detailed Projects</h2>

  <div>
    <h3>American Airlines – Enterprise Azure Data Lake Integration</h3>
    <p>You led the development of a high-throughput data engineering platform on Azure, building ETL pipelines using Talend and Matillion to extract structured and semi-structured data into a Snowflake warehouse. The architecture followed medallion principles (bronze/silver/gold) to improve semantic clarity and maintain governance layers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated modular dbt models to support ML and BI reporting layers.</li>
      <li>Implemented real-time ingestion using Azure Event Hubs and Functions into Snowflake.</li>
      <li>Orchestrated dynamic Matillion pipelines with Python parameterization.</li>
      <li>Boosted Spark job performance in Databricks with partitioning and caching.</li>
      <li>CI/CD enabled via Azure DevOps, Git, and Maven.</li>
      <li>Integrated data governance tools: Collibra, Alation.</li>
      <li>Enabled Power BI dashboards with row-level security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Snowflake, Matillion, Talend, dbt, Spark, Python, Azure Functions, Event Hubs, Power BI</p>

    <h3>PepsiCo – GCP Dataflow & Migration Modernization</h3>
    <p>At PepsiCo, you redesigned legacy ETL workflows and migrated them from Oracle and SAS systems into a scalable, modern stack on Google Cloud Platform. The project emphasized real-time data processing and cost-effective infrastructure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built PySpark ELT workflows on Dataproc and BigQuery with optimized partitioning.</li>
      <li>Migrated legacy Oracle/SAS ETL to Composer-triggered Airflow jobs.</li>
      <li>Deployed secure CI/CD infrastructure using Terraform and GCP IAM.</li>
      <li>Linked Pub/Sub to trigger real-time workflows with Cloud Functions.</li>
      <li>Improved Tableau performance by tuning BigQuery views and datasets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> GCP (BigQuery, Dataproc, Pub/Sub, Composer), Python, Airflow, Terraform, Dataprep, Tableau, Oracle SQL</p>

  <div>
    <h3>AdventHealth – AWS-Powered Clinical Data Exchange</h3>
    <p>You built and managed HIPAA-compliant, real-time clinical data pipelines on AWS. These pipelines ensured accurate ingestion, transformation, and analysis of electronic health records using FHIR and HL7 standards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed real-time ETL with AWS Kinesis, Lambda, and SQS.</li>
      <li>Developed FHIR-compliant APIs for care coordination and interoperability.</li>
      <li>Migrated on-premise data to AWS S3 and Redshift for scalability.</li>
      <li>Standardized metadata and lineage using Talend/Informatica.</li>
      <li>Built dbt models in Snowflake for clean clinical data layers.</li>
      <li>Delivered Power BI dashboards with patient flow and quality metrics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> AWS (Lambda, Kinesis, Redshift, SQS), Snowflake, Talend, Informatica, SSIS, FHIR, HL7, Python, Power BI</p>
